# Fast Fourier transform

Simple implementation of the Fast Fourier transform (FFT) in various languages. 
It includes an implemention of the discreate Fourier transform using the naive $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ algorithm and 
a recursive radix-2 FFT $\mathcal{O}(N\log{N})$. The algorithm can be optimized further.

Curently there is a python, C and a C++ implementation. Theres also a jupyter notebook to compare the performance of each
languages.
